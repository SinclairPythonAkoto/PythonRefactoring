# EasyCHEF 2.0 - basic Flask #

**EasyCHEF** - *Easy Choice of Healthy Eating Food*

This is a basic web app that allows users to recieve a random recipe by giving the program an ingredient.

In this version of my EasyCHEF web app I have included an additional API that allows the user to recieve a random recipe.

The flask app is laid out using **Flask Blueprint**, and also includes **unit testing**.  The areas I have chosen to test are the API calls and the responses recieved back, along with the Flask routes.
