# 1. Write a Python program that iterate over elements repeating each as many times as its count.
# 2. Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts of a specified text.
# 3. Write a Python program to create a new deque with three items and iterate over the deque's elements.
# 4. Write a Python program to find the occurrences of 10 most common words in a given text.
# 5. Write a Python program that accept some words and count the number of distinct words. Print the number
# of distinct words and number of occurrences for each distinct word according to their appearance.
# 6. Write a Python program that accepts number of subjects, subject names and marks. Input number of
# subjects and then subject name, marks separated by a space in next line. Print subject name and marks
# in order of its first occurrence.
# 7. Write a Python program to create a deque and append few elements to the left and right, then remove
# some elements from the left, right sides and reverse the deque.

# 9. Write a Python program to add more number of elements to a deque object from an iterable object.
# 10. Write a Python program to remove all the elements of a given deque object.
# 11. Write a Python program to copy of a deque object and verify the shallow copying process.
# 12. Write a Python program to count the number of times a specific element presents in a deque object.
# 13. Write a Python program to rotate a Deque Object specified number (positive) of times.
# 14. Write a Python program to rotate a Deque Object specified number (negative) of times.
# 15. Write a Python program to find the most common element of a given list.
# 16. Write a Python program to find the second lowest total marks of any student(s) from the given
# names and marks of each student using lists and lambda. Input number of students, names and grades
# of each student.
# 17. Write a Python program to find the majority element from a given array of size n using Collections
# module.

# 23. Write a Python program to get the frequency of the tuples in a given list.
# 24. Write a Python program to calculate the maximum aggregate from the list of tuples (pairs).
# 25. Write a Python program to find the characters in a list of strings which occur more than and
# less than a given number.
# 26. Write a Python program to find the difference between two list including duplicate elements.
# Use collections module.
# 27. Write a Python program to remove duplicate words from a given string use collections module.
# 28. Write a Python program to create a dictionary grouping a sequence of key-value pairs into a
# dictionary of lists. Use collections module.
# 29. Write a Python program to get the frequency of the elements in a given list of lists.
# Use collections module.
# 30. Write a Python program to count the occurrence of each element of a given list.
# 31. Write a Python program to count the most common words in a dictionary.
# 32. Write a Python program to find the class wise roll number from a tuple-of-tuples.
