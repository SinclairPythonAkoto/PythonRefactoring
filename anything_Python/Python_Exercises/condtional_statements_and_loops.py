# 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500
# and 2700 (both included).
# 2. Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
# [ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
# 3. Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 to 9.
# 4. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
# 5. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
# 6. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
# 7. Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from the following list.
# 8. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
# Note : Use 'continue' statement.
# 9. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.
# Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ....
# 10. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print
# "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are
# multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
# 11. Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a
# two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# 12. Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to terminate) as input and
# prints the lines as output (all characters in lower case).
# 13. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as
# its input and print the numbers that are divisible by 5 in a comma separated sequence.
# 14. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
# 15. Write a Python program to check the validity of password input by users.
# 16. Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included) where each digit
# of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence.
