# 1. Write a Python program to generate a random color hex, a random alphabetical string, random
# value between two integers (inclusive) and a random multiple of 7 between 0 and 70. Use random.randint()
# 2. Write a Python program to select a random element from a list, set, dictionary (value) and
# a file from a directory. Use random.choice()
# 3. Write a Python program to generate a random alphabetical character, alphabetical string and
# alphabetical string of a fixed length. Use random.choice()
# 4. Write a Python program to construct a seeded random number generator, also generate a float
# between 0 and 1, excluding 1. Use random.random()
# 5. Write a Python program to generate a random integer between 0 and 6 - excluding 6, random
# integer between 5 and 10 - excluding 10, random integer between 0 and 10, with a step of 3
# and random date between two dates. Use random.randrange()
# 6. Write a Python program to shuffle the elements of a given list. Use random.shuffle()

# going towards 0, with ties going away from 0. Use decimal.ROUND_HALF_DOWN, decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP
# 19. Write a Python program to configure the rounding to round to the nearest, with ties
# going to the nearest even integer. Use decimal.ROUND_HALF_EVEN
