The **Brute Force** method requires us to go throgh all the possibilities of a solution.

*The brute force method requires us to go through all the elements to find what we are looking for.*

- Think of brute force like *(but not limited to)* using a for loop; 
  where it checks each element to see if the condition is true.


### Time Complexity ###
`o(n)` - We would have to do `n` comparisons if the element we want to find is present in the last index of the array.

### Advantages ###
- If a solution to a problem exists, the brute force method will find it this way.
- This allows us to find an initial solution before making it more efficient.

### Disadvantages ###
- This is ***most inefficient*** way of finding a value
- There are no shortcuts and no performance improvements
