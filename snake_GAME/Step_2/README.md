## Creating A Snake ##

We need to create colour variables for the snake and the food that the snake will eat. 
We will use the **RGB colour scheme** *(Red, Green, Blue)*.  If all the RGB values are set to 0 then the colour will be black.  If all the values are set to 255 then the colour will be set to white.
The shape of the snake will be a rectagle, so in order to create a rectangle with PyGame we will use the `draw.rect()` function.
