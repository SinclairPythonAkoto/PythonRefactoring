This will be a folder consiting of my old Python files but refactored in line with standard coding structures and 
practices that I have learned working an a junior developer.

Some will be refactored code from the past, while others will be new implementations that I have learned and applying.
All will be housed in a folder with a README file explaining the purpose of the code.
